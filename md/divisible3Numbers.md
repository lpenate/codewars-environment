Description:
Your task is to write a function that takes two integers `n` and `m`, and returns a sorted array of all integers from `n` to `m` inclusive, which have exactly 3 divisors (excluding 1 and the number itself).

**Example:**
```
solution(2, 20) -> [16]
```
16 has 3 divisors: 2, 4, 8 (1 and 16 aren't included)

**Input:**
- `n` - integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^14)
- `m` - integer (2 ≤ m ≤ 10^18)
    - *NOTE:* In Rust, the bounds are (2 ≤ n ≤ 2^51), (20 ≤ m ≤ 2^52).

**Output:**
- `result` - array of integers
